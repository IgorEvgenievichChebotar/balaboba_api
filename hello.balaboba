Hello everybody, my name is S?rgio. I'm from Brazil, and I've been living in Portugal since 2005. I am a huge fan of the world of Minecraft, I play it almost every day since I was a kid. The game is so much fun that I played it on my computer for years, but today I finally got a console, and it's amazing! I have been playing it for a long time, and now I want to share my experience with you. This is my Minecraft blog.
